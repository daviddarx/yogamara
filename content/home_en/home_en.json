  "intro01": "Yoga has become a self-care ritual for me. Thanks to the constant yoga practice, I get to know my body better and better, I know how to relieve my pain, build sustainable strength and flexibility, come to inner peace and create space for clear thoughts. Yoga is fun too! I love the combination of exercise, sweating, meditating, stretching ... just doing yourself good.",
  "intro02": "We embark on a journey of self-discovery through mindful physical exercises, accompanied by conscious breathing techniques and meditation. The self becomes more transparent and we know better how to minimize our suffering. We learn to be flexible, on and off the (yoga) mat, so that we don't break. The loving treatment of oneself opens our hearts and allows us to face challenges in a relaxed and loving manner. If we perceive consciously, we can take what we have experienced as wisdom on our way. And this is how positive change occurs.",
